# BatchStop
A way to early stopping at batch-level

The core functionality of this method is to enhance training efficiency without significantly affecting model performance. It has been tested on traditional architectures comprising convolutional and fully connected layers across three datasets: SVHN, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, demonstrating its effectiveness. However, it has not yet been tested on other types of architectures. The principle involves extending the early stopping mechanism to the batch level, improving efficiency by interrupting training within an epoch when convergence is achieved or performance begins to deteriorate.

This method is implemented as a callback function for ease of use. It includes several key hyperparameters:

## init_window_size (Observation Window Size)
This parameter defines the range of batches observed at each step, meaning only the most recent batches are considered. The window size affects the stability of the decision-making process: a smaller window is more sensitive but may overreact to short-term fluctuations, while a larger window responds more slowly. Based on extensive testing, it is recommended to set this to 10% of the total number of batches in a single epoch to balance sensitivity and stability.

## adaptive_threshold_factor (Adaptive Threshold Adjustment Factor)
This parameter determines the baseline sensitivity of the decision-making process, using a multiple of the baseline value or standard deviation as the convergence criterion. A higher value reduces sensitivity, avoiding premature stopping but potentially prolonging training, while a lower value increases sensitivity but risks stopping too early due to noise. A recommended range is 0.05–0.5 to achieve a balance between stability and efficiency.

## decline_patience (Patience for Consecutive Declines)
To ensure robust convergence, this parameter sets the allowable number of consecutive declines before triggering the stop condition, preventing early termination due to short-term fluctuations. The patience level determines the tolerance for long-term trends. It is suggested to set this to 5–10% of the total number of batches in a single epoch to effectively balance tolerance and training efficiency.

## min_batches (Start Position for Decision Logic)
This parameter specifies the number of batches after which the decision logic is activated, reducing the impact of large performance fluctuations in the early stages of training. It also ensures that the model undergoes basic training before judgment begins, enhancing reliability. A suggested value is 10–15% of the total number of batches in a single epoch. This range is moderate but should be adjusted based on data quality and training stability.

## adapt_rate (Adaptive Adjustment Rate)
Since model performance fluctuates throughout training, this parameter dynamically adjusts the sensitivity to ensure the decision criteria adapt progressively. The adjustment rate affects the speed of threshold updates: a high rate may lead to overly frequent adjustments, while a low rate might fail to respond to model changes. A recommended range is 0.01–0.1, as it has shown good stability during experimentation.

## Based on research experience, it is advised that the minimum number of batches completed before termination should reach at least 40% of the total to maintain performance stability while improving efficiency.

This is part of my master's thesis project and remains in its early stages, so there are many areas for improvement. Users are encouraged to try this mechanism, provide feedback, and share suggestions to refine its functionality further.
